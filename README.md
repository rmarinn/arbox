# Designed for Ubuntu Linux. Requires Docker.

## LLM Produced Code Notice

This was produced by LLM coding assistance under the direction of humans.
It may be rife with errors, omissions, and bad design decisions.
Use with caution and review the code before trusting it.

## Why?

Rust development is unique in that it has excellent cross-platform tooling
and does not need containerization for sane development. It would be a shame
to move to a full containerized development workflow just for sandbox
support.

The goal of this project is to make it easy to build a host-shaped Docker
container with the same uid, gid, Ubuntu codename, Rust toolchain, and
claude/codex setup (via mounts), and then make it equally easy to launch
claude or codex inside that container with the current git repo mounted at
the same absolute path.

## About (LLM Generated)

A Docker-based agent sandbox for running Claude Code, Codex CLI, and
arbitrary build commands with a narrower view of the host than a normal
shell.

`arbox` builds a per-host Ubuntu image from an embedded Dockerfile, mirrors
your host uid/gid, bind-mounts the current git workspace at the same path,
and runs the requested command as you. The point is fast re-entry into a
host-shaped environment where edits still appear in your normal editor, but
the agent sees only the explicit mounts.

This is intentionally closer to a skinny chroot than to a hardened VM. It is
useful against accidents, prompt injection, and many dependency-script
mistakes; it is not a defense against Docker/container escape vulnerabilities
or a process that you intentionally gave access to your mounted credentials.

## Security model

- **The current git workspace is mounted read-write** at the same absolute
  path inside the container. Edits made by the agent are real host edits.
- **Git worktree common dirs are mounted read-write** when they live outside
  the workspace, so normal git operations keep working in worktrees.
- **Host `~/.rustup` is mounted read-only**, so rustup toolchain payloads
  are not writable from inside the container.
- **Host `~/.cargo` is mounted read-write.** This keeps cargo registry cache,
  config, and installed command shims shared with the host, but it also means
  a compromised process can modify files under `~/.cargo`, including
  `~/.cargo/bin`. Treat this as a convenience tradeoff, not a hard boundary.
- **`~/.claude`, `~/.claude.json`, and `~/.codex` are mounted read-write** so
  credentials and state survive container rebuilds. A compromised agent could
  modify these.
- **Host `~/.gitconfig` is mounted read-only** when present, so git inside
  the container picks up your identity, aliases, and signing config.
- **Optional Claude/Codex binary locations are mounted read-only** from
  `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/share/claude` when those paths exist.
- **The host Wayland display socket is mounted when available** so
  `wl-paste` works for clipboard image flows. Only the socket file is
  mounted, not the full `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
- **Host UID/GID are mirrored** so files written from the container are owned
  by you on the host.
- **The container uses host networking** (`--network host`) because coding
  agents and package managers often need normal network behavior. Do not
  treat the network as isolated.
- **Inside the container, agents run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` /
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.** This is intentional: the
  Docker boundary and explicit mount list are the sandbox.

The host kernel still trusts Docker and the container runtime. This project
defends against common development-agent accidents and many malicious
project-level scripts, not against a determined attacker with a container
escape or host shell access.

## Requirements

- **Ubuntu Linux** host. The image is built from your host's Ubuntu codename
  so libc and toolchain behavior line up with the host.
- **Docker Engine** on `PATH`.
- **[rustup](https://rustup.rs)** installed on the host. `~/.cargo` and
  `~/.rustup` must exist before launching arbox.
- **Git** on the host. The workspace is resolved via `git rev-parse
  --show-toplevel`.
- For the AI clients: **Claude Code** and/or **Codex CLI** authenticated on
  the host. `arbox claude` checks for `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json`;
  `arbox codex` checks for `~/.codex`. `arbox bash` and `arbox run` do not
  require agent config directories.

## Install

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/approck/arbox
cd arbox
cargo install --path .
```

This drops `arbox` into `~/.cargo/bin`. Make sure that's on your `PATH`.

## Quick start

```bash
cd ~/code/some-rust-project
arbox status                       # inspect detected host facts and mounts
arbox build                        # optional; launch commands auto-build too
arbox bash                         # interactive bash, project auto-mounted
arbox run -- cargo test            # one-off command
arbox claude                       # Claude Code, project auto-mounted
arbox codex                        # Codex CLI, project auto-mounted
```

The first build can take a few minutes because the image installs common
development packages plus uv and deno. Subsequent launches reuse the per-host
image tag, which is `arbox:<ubuntu-codename>-uid<uid>-<dockerfile-hash>`.
The Dockerfile-content hash is the trailing 8 hex chars; editing the
embedded Dockerfile changes the hash, which makes the next launch verb
notice the missing tag and rebuild automatically. `arbox clean` wipes every
image with your host's prefix, including stale ones from earlier Dockerfile
revisions.

The Dockerfile is multi-arch via BuildKit's `TARGETARCH`. amd64 (x86_64) and
arm64 (aarch64) hosts both work; other architectures fail the build with a
clear message.

## Commands

| Command                         | Description |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `arbox claude [FLAGS] -- ARGS...` | Run Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. |
| `arbox codex  [FLAGS] -- ARGS...` | Run Codex CLI with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. |
| `arbox bash   [FLAGS]`          | Open an interactive login bash inside the container. |
| `arbox run    [FLAGS] -- CMD...`  | Run a one-off command inside the container. |
| `arbox build`                   | Build the host-specific Docker image. |
| `arbox build --force`           | Remove the existing image tag before rebuilding. |
| `arbox build --no-cache`        | Pass `--no-cache` to `docker build`. |
| `arbox status`                  | Show host facts, mount layout, image presence, and network mode. Works outside a git repository (skips the workspace mount in that case). |
| `arbox clean`                   | Remove every arbox image whose tag has the current host's prefix. |

`claude`, `codex`, `bash`, and `run` must be invoked from inside a git
repository — they mount the git toplevel as the workspace and `cd` into your
current directory. `status`, `build`, and `clean` do not require a repo.

### Extra bind-mount flags

`claude`, `codex`, `bash`, and `run` accept zero or more `--rw <PATH>` and
`--ro <PATH>` options. Each path is canonicalized (relative paths and
symlinks resolve against the host filesystem) and mounted at the same
absolute path inside the container.

```bash
arbox bash --rw ~/scratch
arbox run --rw /tmp/build-out --ro /opt/data -- cargo build
arbox claude --rw ~/code/sibling-repo --ro ~/datasets/fixtures
```

Required to exist on the host; launches fail loudly if a path is missing.

## How it works

1. `host::detect()` reads UID/GID, passwd username/home, current directory,
   `$TERM`, and `/etc/os-release`. It also tries to resolve the git toplevel
   and common dir, but tolerates failure so non-launch verbs work outside a
   repo.
2. `host::require_supported_distro()` rejects non-Ubuntu hosts for now;
   launch verbs additionally call `host::require_git()` to demand a workspace.
3. `image::ensure_built()` derives the image tag from the host codename, uid,
   and an 8-char hash of the embedded Dockerfile bytes
   (`arbox:<codename>-uid<uid>-<hash>`). When the Dockerfile changes, the tag
   changes, so missing-image detection automatically triggers a rebuild on
   the next launch.
4. The Dockerfile starts from `ubuntu:<host-codename>`, installs common
   development tools plus pinned uv and deno binaries (architecture chosen
   from BuildKit's `TARGETARCH`), mirrors the host user/group, and puts
   `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, and system bins on `PATH`.
5. `launch::mount_specs()` builds the explicit bind-mount list for the
   workspace, git worktree metadata, Rust toolchain, agent credentials, and
   optional local client installs. User-supplied `--rw`/`--ro` paths are
   appended after canonicalization.
6. `docker run --rm -i --network host --user UID:GID --workdir <cwd>` runs
   the selected command with host-shaped paths and inherited stdio. `-t` is
   added only when stdin is an interactive terminal.

## Customization

Most behavior is controlled by what's on your host:

- The image follows your host's Ubuntu codename from `/etc/os-release`.
- The container user and home directory come from `getpwuid_r`, not from
  `$USER` or `$HOME`.
- The current directory selects the git workspace to mount.
- Editing `src/Dockerfile` invalidates the cached image tag automatically;
  the next launch verb rebuilds with no extra flags. `arbox build --force`
  is only needed when you want to rebuild without changing the Dockerfile
  (e.g. to refresh apt mirrors).
- Add ad-hoc directories with `--rw`/`--ro` per-invocation; permanent
  additions belong in `launch::mount_specs`.

## Development

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

The unit tests do not require Docker. End-to-end behavior requires an Ubuntu
host with Docker and the expected host config directories.
